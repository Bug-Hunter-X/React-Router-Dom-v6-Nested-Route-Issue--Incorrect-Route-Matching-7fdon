This repository demonstrates a bug in React Router Dom v6 where nested routes with parameters exhibit incorrect matching behavior.  The issue arises when a nested route is defined within a parent route, and the parent route also has a matching path. In this specific case, the ContactDetails component is unexpectedly rendered even when a parameter is not passed to the URL. The solution shows how to resolve this issue by making the parent route path more specific and utilizing the `useParams` hook effectively within the ContactDetails component.
